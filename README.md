# Fastest Loop in JS (with two different runtimes)

This repository's goal is to compare the performance of different loops in JavaScript. The loops are tested with two different runtimes: [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en).

## Running the tests

### Node

`node node/index.js`

### Bun

`bun run index.ts`
